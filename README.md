Task Description

First, create an account for yourself with OpenRouter.ai and get an API key

Then, write a simple function call that will use direct API call (in Python, JavaScript, Dart, or any preferred language) that does the following:

    Accepts a user prompt as an argument

    Sends this user prompt to an AI text generation API.

    Extracts the response from the LLM and returns the value.

 

Additionally, use this function to make a CLI (command-line interface) script that accepts the prompt as a command-line argument and prints the response to console.

 
Requirements

    Do not hardcode your API key in the code, rather use environment variables

    The following environment variable names should be used:

        OPENROUTER_API_KEY for the API key

        MODEL_NAME for the name of the model you are calling

    Load your environment variables from a `.env` file in the same folder as the main file, however, this file should not be in your repo to avoid leaking API keys

    Save your code in a single script file called `main.py` or `main.js` or `main.ts` or `main.dart` or `main.go` depending on the programming language of choice.
